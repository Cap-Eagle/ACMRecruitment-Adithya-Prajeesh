Steps
Look at the 2×2 square in the top-left corner. It has a 3 there and the only place left for number 1 in that box is the top-left cell. So put 1 there.

Now check the first column and second column. Because of the numbers already placed, the remaining empty spots in those columns will be 2 and 4 (order not confirmed). So the empty cells in those two columns are only 2 or 4.

In the third row, the only place that can hold 1 is the third cell of that row. Put 1 there.

Using that, the bottom-right cell must be 3 (it’s the only place left in that row IS 3). Put 3 there.

After those forced moves, only 2 and 4 remain in the empty spots. Put them where they don’t break the rules That finishes the puzzle.
