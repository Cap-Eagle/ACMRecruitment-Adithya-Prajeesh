Three-switches

First, we turn on the 1st switch and wait for 10 minutes. Then turn it off and now turn on the 2nd switch and go inside the room.

If the bulb is glowing, it is the 2nd switch. 

If it is not glowing, go touch it.

If it feels hot, it's the 1st switch because if we keep switch 1 on for 10 minutes and if the bulb were connected to switch 1  it would become hot. 

If it's not hot, then it's the 3rd switch.
